= IO-Reactor

An implementation of the Reactor design pattern for multiplexed asynchronous
single-thread IO.

== Authors

 Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>


== Description

This module is a pure-Ruby implementation of an asynchronous multiplexed IO
Reactor which is based on the Reactor design pattern found in _Pattern-Oriented
Software Architecture, Volume 2: Patterns for Concurrent and Networked
Objects_. It allows a single thread to demultiplex and dispatch events from one
or more IO objects to the appropriate handler.

This module used to be called Ruby-Poll, and used to use the poll(2) system
call, but this strategy was not portable, and didn't work with Ruby's
threads. It now uses IO::select, which should work everywhere Ruby does.

I would greatly appreciate feedback on any aspect of this software. Suggestions,
feature requests, questions, design critiques, and bug reports are most
welcome. Relevant patches and minimal test cases are particularly helpful. I may
be reached by email at <ged@FaerieMUD.org>.


== Requirements

* Ruby >= 1.8.0

Optional:

* Dave Thomas's RDoc documentation tool to make HTML documentation.
* The Test::Unit module, to run the included test suite.


== Installation

  $ su
  # ruby install.rb

If you have the Test::Unit module installed, you can run the test suite by
doing:

  $ ruby test.rb
