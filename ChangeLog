	  by
	  Nick Mathewson <nickm@freehaven.net>.

2003-04-21 04:32  deveiant

	* extconf.rb: Added fake poll code to allow machines without a
	  poll(2) to use the library. This also might become the primary
	  method of polling, sadly, as Ruby doesn't tolerate other async IO
	  methods very well due to its use of select() for its threading.

2002-10-21 03:47  deveiant

	* lib/io/reactor.rb, lib/poll.rb: - Got rid of a type-checking
	  statement, as it didn't account for using an IO
